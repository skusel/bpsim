# bpsim
bpsim is a web-based branch prediction simulator capable of simulating not taken, taken, one-bit, two-bit, and two-level predictors on user created patterns.

## Project Goals
This project was written as a way to learn the React front-end framework.

I wanted to write something that I was unable to find as an existing web-app, and I think branch prediction is an interesting topic, so I came up with the app you see here.

I purposefully avoided using bootstrap to gain a better understanding of the code in the popular CSS library.
